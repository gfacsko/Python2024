sectionIntroduction labelsec:introThe solar corona is hotter than the photosphere the chromosphere and the transient layers beneath it As a result the high temperatures ionize atoms creating a plasma of free-moving electrons and ions the so-called solar wind Historically citepparker58:dynamintergasmagnetfield predicted the existence of the solar wind and coined terms describing it He deduced it based on German astronomer Ludwig Bierman's observation of how the comet tail always points away from the Sun citepbiermann57:solar The existence of the solar wind was confirmed by the Mariner 2 spacecraft citepsnyder65:intersolarwindmeasurmarinii The solar wind is a collisionless plasma whose speed is both supersonic and super-Alfvenic The latter means that its speed exceeds the Alfv'en speed which is a representative speed of magnetohydrodynamic waves in a plasma Due to addedthe abrupt change of the solar wind speed from supersonic to subsonic (eg by encountering an obstacle) a shock wave replacedis emergedemerges Interplanetary (IP) shock waves are common in the heliosphere which is a bubble-like region of space surrounding the Sun and extending far beyond the orbits of the planets and is filled with the solar wind There are many varieties of shocks such as planetary bow shocks shocks that deletedare risedeletedn due to the stream interaction regions (SIR) which are called co-rotation interaction regionaddeds (CIR) when extending beyond 1 AU citep[see for example in][]koban23:oriencirs and coronal mass ejection (CME) driven shocks IP shocks are one of the main and efficient accelerators of energetic particles in the heliosphere citeptsurutani85:accelau keith21:histor These accelerated particles can enter the geomagnetic field and are hazardous to astronauts and satellites IP shocks driven by CMEs can trigger large geomagnetic storms that can damage oil and gas pipelines and interfere with electrical power infrastructures citepgonzalez94:what GPS navigation and high-frequency radio communications are also affected by ionosphere irregularities brought on by geomagnetic storms citepcid14 and can cause internet disruptions around the world citepjyothi21:solarsuperfacsko24:spaceweatheffeccriticinfras Therefore IP shocks are important in determining and understanding space weather Some dayside magnetospheric transient events citep[see references therein]zhang22:daysidtransphenomtheirimpacmagnetionos generated by the interaction of a discontinuity frozen in the solar wind and the terrestrial bow shock This fact raises the questions of how stabdeletedile the discontinuities are how long these phenomena traveldeleteds with the solar wind and whether they evolve during their travel or show some wave dispersion citep[Istv'an Ballai personal communication]facsko05:identstatisanalyhotflow Dayside magnetospheric transient events are generated by tangential (TD) and rotational discontinuities (RD) However there are catalogues for neither TDs nor RDs Therefore it is easier to study IP shocks because many were observed and listed previously (see Section~refsec:ipshock)

In this study we focus on the macroscopic structure and parameters of the observed IP shock events The structure of this paper is as follows: we first list and describe briefly the missions instruments and databases that we used in this study in Section~refsec:mis We describe the applied analysis methods in Section~refsec:methods Then we introduce the datasets that we analysed in Section~refsec:obs We discuss and analyse the observations in Section~refsec:disc Finally we summarize the results of our study in Section~refsec:sum

subsectionThe STEREO mission labelsec:stereo

NASA's twin STEREO A and B spacecraft were launched on October 26 2006 from Kennedy Space Center In heliospheric orbit at 1AU STEREO$-$A (Ahead) leads while STEREO$-$B (Behind) trails Earth The two spacecraft separate at $44^circ$ in heliographic longitude from each other annually Both spacecraft were equipped with two instruments and two instrument suites with a total of 13 instruments on each spacecraft

The PLAsma and SupraThermal Ion Composition (PLASTIC) instrument measures protons and alpha particle parameters as well as the composition of heavy ions in the solar wind plasma citepgalvin08:plasmsuprationcomposplast The In-situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients magnetic field experiment (IMPACT) suite of instruments consists of seven instruments among which three are located on deletedon a 6-meter long boom replacedwhile tThe other four are installed in the addedmain part of the spacecraft citepacuna08:stereoimpacmagnetfieldexper The IMPACT measures the parameters of protons heavy ions and electrons and the MAG magnetometer sensor in it measures the in situ magnetic fields in a range of $pm 512nT$ with 01nT replacedaccuracyresolution citepkaiser07:stereo

We downloaded all data from NASA's Coordinated Data Analysis Web (CDAWeb urlhttps://cdawebgsfcnasagov/) We obtained the STEREO$-$A and B magnetic field observation and the ion plasma data from the STEREO IMPACT with the time resolution of 100 ms and the STEREO PLASTIC instruments respectively The magnetic field and the plasma data of the STEREO$-$A and B are in the RTN spacecraft coordinate system where R is radially outward from the Sun T is along the planetary orbital and N is northward direction

subsectionThe Wind mission labelsec:wind

NASA's Wind spacecraft was launched on November 1 1994 citeplin95:threedimenplasmenergparticwilson21:quartcenturwindspacecdiscov The Wind was initially sent to $L1$ Lagrange point however the reaching of $L1$ was delayed deletedin order to be able to study in advance the terrestrial deletedthe magnetosphere and lunar environment as well Following a sequence of orbital adjustments the Wind spacecraft was positioned in a Lissajous orbit close to the $L1$ Lagrange point in early 2004 for studying the incoming solar wind citepteam20:windspacec

The spacecraft is equipped with eight instruments however we used only the Magnetic Field Investigation citep[MFI;][]lepping95:windmagnetfieldinves and the Three-Dimensional Plasma and Energetic Particle Investigation citep[3DP][]lin95:threedimenplasmenergpartic measurements in this study The MFI consists of two magnetometers at the 12-meter boomadded they measuredeleteds magnetic field from 4$$nT to 65536$$nT with a time resolution of 22 or 11 vectors per second in the calibrated high-resolution mode while in the primary science mode the resolution can be three seconds one minute and one hour citepteam22:winddatasourc The 3DP measures the solar wind key parameters such as velocity density and temperature

From CDAWeb we got Wind magnetic and plasma data from the MFI and 3DP instrumens with a time resolution of 3s replacedrespectivelyfor both The magnetic field and the plasma data of the Wind are in the Geocentric Solar Ecliptic System (GSE) coordinate system where addedthe X-axis is pointing to the Sun from the Earth Y-axis is in the ecliptic plane showing opposite to the planetary motion and Z-axis is the northward direction

subsectionThe ACE mission labelsec:ace

NASA's ACE spacecraft was launched on August 25 1997   citepstone98:advancomposexplor The spacecraft is located at $L1$ Lagrangian point similarly to the Wind spacecraft The spacecraft is equipped with nine primary scientific instruments and one engineering instrument We used in the study the measurements of the Magnetometer citep[MAG;][]smith98:acemagnetfieldexper and the Solar Wind Electron Proton and Alpha Monitor citep[SWEPAM;][]mccomas98:solarwindelectprotonalpha The MAG consists of twin triaxial flux-gate magnetometers such that magnetometer sensors have between 3 and 6 vectors $s^-1$ resolutions for continuous observation of the interplanetary magnetic field citepsmith98:acemagnetfieldexper

From CDAWeb we downloaded the ACE magnetic and plasma data from the ACE MAG with a time resolution of 1s and from SWEPAM with a time resolution of 64s respectively The magnetic field and the plasma data are both in the RTN and GSE coordinate systems

subsectionThe Cluster fleet labelsec:cluster

ESA's Cluster constellations consist of four satellites which were launched on 16 July and 9 August 2000 citepcredland97:clustmissionescoubet01:introd The Cluster satellites orbit in a tetrahedral formation around Earth The perigee and apogee of the orbit are approximately four and 196$RE$ respectively citepzhang10:emiche Each of the four satellites is equipped with 11 identical instruments We used the data of the Cluster Ion Composition citep[CIS;][]reme97:clustionspectexperreme01:firstearthclustcis the Fluxgate Magnetometer citep[FGM;][]balogh97:clustmagnetfieldinvesbalogh01:clustmagnetfieldinves and the Electric field and waves citep[EFW;][]gustafsson97:electfieldwaveexperclustmissiongustafsson01:firstclustefw instruments in this study 

The FGM is composed of two tri-axial fluxgate magnetometers which are installed on one of the two 5-meter radial booms It measures in the dynamic range $pm 65536$nT At the highest dynamic level the resolution is $pm8$nT and the time resolution is 100 vectors per second citepbalogh97:clustmagnetfieldinvesbalogh01:clustmagnetfieldinvesorganization21:fluxgmagnetfgm The CIS instrument measures three-dimensional ion distribution and it is composed of two distinct sensors: the Composition Distribution Function (CODIF) sensor and the Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) sensor citepreme97:clustionspectexperreme01:firstearthclustcis The CIS experiment is not operational for Cluster-2 and the HIA sensor is switched off for Cluster-4 due to a problem with the high voltage of the electrostatic analyzer citepteam21:clustactivarchiv Hence for Cluster-2 and Cluster-4 the EFW instrument measurement became more indispensable for the analyses because we could obtain electron density in another way independently from ion and electron plasma measurements citepgustafsson97:electfieldwaveexperclustmissiongustafsson01:firstclustefw

As the spacecraft travels through the plasma environment it acquires an electric charge as a result of contact with charged particles This charging process results in an electrical potential discrepancy between the spacecraft and the plasma around it a phenomenon referred to as spacecraft potential The EFW instrument measures the spacecraft potential and the electron density of the plasma could be calculated using an empirical formula

where $Ne$ is the calculated electron density and $Vsc$ is the Cluster EFW spacecraft potential citepsandhu16:clusttrotignon10:whisprelaxsoundclustactivarchivtrotignon11:calibreporwhispmeasurclust

From CDAWeb we acquired the magnetic data of Cluster satellites from the Cluster FGM with a time resolution of 4s for all the four Cluster satellites ion data from the Cluster CIS with a time resolution of 4s for the Cluster~SC1 and SC3 satellites and the spacecraft potential data from EFW with a time resolution of 4s for the Cluster~SC2 and SC4 satellites where CIS measurements were not available All the Cluster data were in the GSE coordinate system

sectionIP shock events and transformations labelsec:ipshock

IP shock candidates are chosen from the shock lists in the Database of Heliospheric Shock Waves maintained at the University of Helsinki urlhttp://wwwipshocksfi/ For the event selection we chose the year 2007 because STEREO$-$A and STEREO$-$B were close to each other near the Sun-Earth line In the first event May 07 deletedof 2007 the selected spacecraft are STEREO$-$A STEREO$-$B Wind and the four Cluster satellites For the second event April 23 2007 the spacecraft are STEREO$-$A and B ACE and Wind

After choosing the shock candidates and obtaining the data we transformedaddeddata coordinates in such a way that all the coordinate systems are changed to the Heliocentric Earth Ecliptic (HEE) coordinate system where the X-axis is toward the Earth from the Sun Z-axis is the ecliptic northward direction while Y axis completes the right-handed Cartesian system deletedThis system is fixed with conserning the Sun-Earth line To transform from the RTN and the GSE coordinate systems to the HEE coordinate system we used Transformation de REp`eres en Physique Spatiale (TREPS; urlhttp://trepsirapompeu/) online tool The TREPS tool which is developed by the French Plasma Physics Data Centre (CDPP) the national data centre in France for the solar system plasmas is based on SPICE (Spacecraft Planet Instrument C-matrix and Events) information system kernels created by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) tool citepgenot18:treps

sectionAnalysis methods labelsec:methods

Usually coplanarity method is applied to find the shock normal The coplanarity method is based on the magnetic coplanarity theorem which states that the magnetic field vectors on both sides of the shock and the shock normal lie in the same plane Similarly the velocity on both sides or in other words the velocity jump through the shock also lie in the same plane The method of magnetic coplanarity is straightforward to implementdeleted and it only magnetic field data is needed for applying the method citeppaschmann98:analymethodmultispacecdataschwartz98:shockdisconnormalmachnumberrelatparam

We select two intervals upstream and downstream of the shock calculate average upstream and downstream magnetic field vectors using the values of the interval and determine the shock normal vector using the coplanarity method However in this case the magnetic field varies strongly therefore the calculated shock normal vector looks very sensitive for the selected intervals if one useaddeds only the coplanarity method Hence the calculated shock normals for each spacecraft pointed in different directions The result cannot be explained physically therefore applying the coplanarity method only is pointless in this case Hence we need the support of another method in this case

Therefore we use Minimum Variance Analysis (MVA) citepsonnerup98:minimmaximvariananaly schwartz98:shockdisconnormalmachnumberrelatparam and magnetic co-planarity (CP) methods to determine the IP shock normals The MVA technique is based on the assumption that variations in the magnetic field would be observed when a single spacecraft passes through a 1D (in reality it is a 2D or 3D transition layer) current layer or wavefront The divergence of the magnetic field addedis constrainreplacedted $left(nabla cdot mathbfB = 0right)$ therefore the normal component of the magnetic field must remain constant If such a normal direction can be found then the variations in the magnetic field are zero or at the least have a minimum variance citepsonnerup67:magnetstrucattitexplorobsersonnerup98:minimmaximvariananalywang24:solarwindcurrensheet MVA can only work if there are less fluctuations in the direction normal to the shock than in the direction perpendicular to magnetic fields upstream and downstream from the shock

By comparing the two methods the upstream and downstream time intervals of the magnetic field measurements are set We set up the following requirements to accept the results:
beginenumerate
item The angle between the shock normal vectors obtained by the minimum variance analysis (MVA) and the magnetic coplanarity method must be less than $15^circ$
item The ratio between the intermediate eigenvalue and the smallest eigenvalue should be greater than 2
endenumerate
The above methods have been used in previous studies for shocks citepbebesi10:slowjovianbebesi19:obserkronianborodkova19:finestrucintershockfrontnikbakhsh14:intershan13:comparmvavenusterasawa05:deteroctob Similar conditions have been used in other studies for tangential discontinuities citepfacsko08:clustfacsko09:clustfacsko10:studyclust % sonnerup67:magnetstrucattitexplorobser

We apply both methods for every single spacecraft The shock normal vectors calculated independently point to a similar direction This result is accqchangedaeptable and could be explained physically We suppose that the same shock passes all spacecraft at different times and locations The shock is supposed to be a bit curved and perhaps ripped Therefore applying both methods leads to a valuable and acceptable result

sectionObservations labelsec:obs

With the visual inspection of the magnetic field and plasma data we identified jumps in magnetic field ($mathbfB$) speed ($mathbfV$) density (N) and temperature (T) Using these quantities we determined the times when shock events occurred for each spacecraft data set The common origin of a shock event detected by different spacecraft can be concluded from the similar time profiles of the magnetic field and plasma data recorded in each spacecraft position near deletedto the shock From the positions of the spacecraft and the times of shock arrivals to the different positions the shock geometry and the propagation parameters (velocity direction) can be deduced The following case studies of two events are replacednot orderly defined for one anotherdiscussed in reversed time order First we analyzed the shock event on May 7 2007 and then the event on April 23 2007

subsectionEvent May 7 2007 labelsec:event20070507

On May 7 2007 the Wind spacecraft deletedfirst detected the shock addedfirst at 07:02:30 (UTC) After that the STEREO$-$A spacecraft detected the shock at 08:11:30 (UTC) and then the STEREO$-$B spacecraft detected the shock at 09:42:00 (UTC) The four Cluster satellites detectaddeded the shock as well Cluster SC1 detected the shock at 08:27:55 (UTC) and Cluster SC3 detected the shock at 08:28:00 (UTC) The magnetic field and the plasma parameters are shown in Figure~reffig:ip0507 for the Wind (a) for the STEREO$-$A(b) for the STEREO$-$B (c) in Figure~reffig:cl0507 for the Cluster SC1 (a) and SC3 (b) There is no indication in the shock database that Cluster SC2 and SC4 detected a shock in the analysed period However since the four Cluster spacecraft are located close to each other they all had to encounter the given shock Without plasma data on Cluster SC2 and SC4 satellites a shock cannot be confirmed based solely on the magnetic field data However using the empirical formula described in Section~refsec:cluster the electron density could be estimated using EFW spacecraft potential data Therefore comparing the magnetic field and the electron plasma density profile the shock is determined The Cluster SC2 detected the shock at 08:28:10 (UTC) according to the magnetic field and density plots (Figure~reffig:cl0507c) The Cluster SC4 detected the shock at the same time as SC2 (Figure~reffig:cl0507d) Similarly The electron density parameter is obtained by the empirical formula (Eq~refeq:empdens)

Here we list all magnetic field observations of the spacecraft for the event and apply the MVA and the CP methods to them The upstream and downstream time intervals that most agree between the MVA and the CP for all the spacecraft are shown in Table~reftab:timeintervalsmay and their corresponding magnetic field plots are shown in Figure~reffig:b20070507 for Wind (a) STEREO$-$A (b) STEREO$-$B (c) while in Figure~reffig:clb20070507 for Cluster spacecraft Table~reftab:timeintervalsmay also shows the ratio between the smallest eigenvalue $lambda3$ and the intermediate eigenvalue $lambda2$ as well as the angle between the MVA normal and CP normals in the determined upstream and downstream time intervals for each spacecraft

The accepted upstream and downstream time intervals were properly selected considering the angle difference between the results obtained by the two methods is minimal and the eigenvalue criteria are sufficient for each spacecraft data Using the determined time intervals the calculations of the ratio between the upstream and downstream total magnetic fields ion plasma densities and ion plasma temperatures as well as the bulk speed and shock $thetaBn$ angle are made These parameters the MVA normal and the magnetic CP normals are shown in Table~reftab:core1 The shock parameters fulfil the necessary shock criteria citeplumme17:databheliosshockwaves The results of the additional parameter calculations are shown in Table~reftab:core2

Using the results the 2D sketches of the IP shocks that were detected by the spacecraft are shown in Figure~reffig:05072D In these 2D sketches the shock propagation and normal vector orientation are shown in a temporal development manner Since four Cluster satellites are relatively close to one another their averaged position as well as normal vectors are shown in the general 2D sketches (also in 3D sketches see later) For explicitly showing normal vector directions and positions of all Clusters satellites it is suitable to change their coordinates and normal vectors into a GSE coordinate system with the positions in the Earth radii ($RE$) unit see Figure~reffig:clustertogether

The 3D sketches of the shock normals are shown in Figure~reffig:05073Ddeleted and the 3D sketch the STEREO$-$A and B and averaged Clusters positions are time-shifted to the position of Wind to see the overall shape of this IP shock In order to assess the shape of the shock we shifted the shock normals hence as they had been detected contemporary with the shock observation time in Wind For this we used the average solar wind speeds and the timereplaced- differences between the observations in Wind and deletedin the three other missions The shifted shock normals are shown in Figure~reffig:05073Db It turns out that the starting points of all of the normal vectoraddeds lay approximately in a plane surface meaning that the underlying shock exhibits a planar structure in the spatial scale of the spacecraft distances The plane fitted to the time-shifted normals is shown in Figure~reffig:05073Dc

subsectionEvent April 23 2007 labelsec:event20070423

In this specific event the STEREO$-$A spacecraft detected a shock first at 06:53:35 (UTC) then the ACE spacecraft detected the shock at 08:57:00 (UTC) and the Wind spacecraft detected the shock at 09:12:00 (UTC) The magnetic field and the plasma data are shown in Figure~reffig:ip20070423 for the STEREO$-$A (a) ACE (b) deletedand Wind (c)added and STEREO$-$B (d)

STEREO$-$A and B have identical instruments therefore STEREO$-$B must have detected the shock on that day even though there is no detected IP shock for STEREO$-$B in the shock lists database mentioned in Section~refsec:ipshock So by using the average solar wind speed 400km/s we concluded that the shock detection time for STEREO$-$B should be around 13:00 to 15:00 Considering this a possible shock signature from STEREO$-$B is found around 13:21:30 even though it is a faint signature The magnetic field and the plasma plot are shown in Figure~reffig:ip20070423d

We use all magnetic field observations of the spacecraft about the event and apply the MVA and the CP methods to them In this event the order between upstream and downstream is swapped because it is a fast-reverse (FR) shock event which means the shock propagates toward the Sun against the flow replacedhoweverbut is carried outward from the Sun by the bulk solar wind flow citekilpua15:properearth The upstream and downstream time intervals that give the best agreement between the results of the MVA and CP shock normal determination for all spacecraft are shown in Table~reftab:timeintervalsapriladded Figure~reffig:b20070423 shows the corresponding magnetic field observations for STEREO$-$A (a) ACE (b) Wind (c) and STEREO$-$B (d) missions Table~reftab:timeintervalsapril also shows the ratio between the intermediate eigenvalue $lambda2$ and the smallest eigenvalue $lambda3$ as well as the angle between the MVA and CP normal vector determinations of the shock in the upstream and downstream time intervals for each spacecraft

Similarly to the Event May 7 the upstream and downstream time intervals are defined correctly as well considering the angle difference between the two methods is minimal and the eigenvalue criteria are fulfilled for each spacecraft data Also using the determined time intervals in Table~reftab:coreapril1 we summarize for each mission the ratio between the upstream and downstream total magnetic fields densities and temperatures addedand the differences between the upstream and downstream solar wind bulk speeds From the obtained upstream/downstream ratios and bulk speed differences we conclude that the criteria for detecting a saddedhock event in the considered period is fulfilled citeplumme17:databheliosshockwaves for each spacecraft Even for STEREO$-$B for which shock was not indicated in the shock catalogue (see above) the numbers unambiguously prove the existence of a shock event during the studied interval However the almost quasi-parallel shock detected by the STEREO$-$B appears to become quasi-parallel a few hours after the shock detection times of STEREO$-$A ACE and the Wind based on the shock $thetaBn$ angle see Table~reftab:coreapril1 where the calculated results of additional parameters are shown

The sketches of the IP shockdeleteds geometries that were detected by the spacecraft are shown in Figure~reffig:04232D In these 2D sketches the shock propagation and normal vector orientation are shown in a temporal development manner

The 3D sketch of the IP shock geometries are shown in Figure~reffig:04233D The 3D sketch the STEREO$-$A and B positions are time-shifted to the position of STEREO$-$A to see the overall shape of this IP shock In order to assess the shape of the shock we shifted the shock normals hence as they had been detected contemporary with the shock observation time in STEREO$-$A For this we used the average solar wind speeds and the timereplaced- differences between the observations in STEREO$-$A and in the two other spacecraft The shifted shock normals are shown in the top right panel of Figure~reffig:04233D The top view of the time-shifted normals is shown in the bottom part of Figure~reffig:04233D


sectionDiscussion
labelsec:disc

The IP shock parameters did not change significantly deletedmost separated couple of probes from STEREO$-$A to B in deletedneither case (Table~reftab:core1 reftab:core2~reftab:coreapril1 reftab:coreapril2) replacedThere is no sign of wave dispersionThe IP shocks did not evolve on the scale of 40millionkm that is the distance of the STEREO spacecraft

subsectionEvent May 7 2007 labelsec:disc20070507

The IP shock fitted plane is tilted $5642^circ$ from the Sun-Earth line according to Figure~reffig:05073Dc The tilt appears to be almost the same as expected for the Parker spiral impacting the Earth from the dawn side Hence it is the reason why the Wind detected the shock first even though STEREO$-$A's position is relatively closer to the Sun's direction This period 2007 was during the solar minimum phase and stream interaction region (SIR) or co-rotating stream interactions (CIR) were dominant citepopitz14:solarstereo and this further proves the result see Figure~reffig:cirpaper Furthermore to see a correlation between fast-forward shock and geomagnetic activity we investigated the $Kp$-index citep[urlhttps://wwwswpcnoaagov/noaa-scales-explanation]bartels49:indexksplanetkpiatmebullrostoker72:geomagmatzka21:geomagkpindexderivindicgeomagactiv on May 07 2007 as shown in Figure~reffig:kp0507 It appears that this forward shock-leading event disturbed the magnetosphere causing a G1-minor geomagnetic storm with the $Kp$- index peaking around 15:00 (UTC) The geomagnetic substorm happened about 6 hours after the detection of the shock by the STEREO$-$B spacecraft

subsectionEvent April 23 2007 labelsec:disc20070423

In Figure~reffig:04233D it seems that the shape of the shock is not uniform and is twisted from the STEREO$-$A spacecraft to the other three spacecraft in the Z-axis along the transverse direction (Y-axis) to the Sun-Earth line see Figure~reffig:04233Db As seen from Figure~reffig:04233Dc the STEREO$-$A alone is on the replacedduskdawn (left) side of the Sun-Earth line while the Wind the ACE and the STEREO$-$B are on the replaceddawndusk (right) In this XY-plane view (Figure~reffig:04233D) the shock normal vectors appear to be changing or slightly rotating their direction from the STEREO$-$A to the Wind the ACE and the STEREO$-$B about the Z-axis and the shock is changing from the quasi-perpendicular to quasi-parallel based on the shock $thetaBn$ angle This IP shock is a fast reverse shock meaning it travels toward the Sun in a frame fixed to the solar wind even though the shock propagates away from the Sun with the solar wind The shock detection time difference between the STEREO$-$A and the Wind/ACE is about two hours while between STEREO$-$A and B is almost six hours Yet the shock orientation is significantly changed from the STEREO$-$A to the other three spacecraft indicating the change is spatial not temporal So due to this nature the IP shock could be a local ripple The ripples on the shock surface are known addedto be caused by ICME (interplanetary coronal mass ejections) shock drivers as they do not propagate into homogeneous interplanetary medium citepacuna08:stereoimpacmagnetfieldexper However for this particular event the source is suggested to be a stream interaction region (SIR) according to the catalogue given in urlhttps://stereo-sscnascomnasagov/pub/insdata/impact/level3/STEREOLevel3Shockpdf

We investigated the $Kp$-index of this event as seen in Figure~reffig:kp0423 Similar to the fast-forward shock event of May 07 2007 a G1-minor geomagnetic storm occurred on this day (see space weather scales of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) urlhttps://wwwswpcnoaagov/noaa-scales-explanation) but the beginning of the geomagnetic storm happened three hours before the shock detection time of the STEREO$-$A while the ending of the storm was partially at the same time as the STEREO$-$A addedshock detection As stated before SIR/CIRs form when the fast-moving solar wind catches the slow-moving solar wind citerichardson18:solar This sometimes forms a pair of shocks one leading as a fast-forward shock while a rarefied shock trails the solar wind as a fast-reverse shock but oftentimes as just sole fast-forward or fast reverse shocks citepjian19:solarterresrelatobserstereo Nevertheless since it always involves the fast-moving solar wind it makes total sense why the G1-minor geomagnetic storm with a $Kp$-5 index happened before the detection of the shock because it seems the fast-moving solar wind caused the minor storm before the fast-reverse shock finally arrived at the spacecraft positions

The normal orientation inconsistency can also be explained by the argument that this shock is a fast-reverse shock because SIRs have characteristic tilts such that forward waves direct towards the solar equatorial plane while the reverse waves tend to move in the direction of the solar poles citepkilpua15:properearth Therefore this tilting nature may explain the XZ componentadded's tilted orientation between the STEREO$-$A and the other three spacecraft -- the Wind the ACE and the STEREO$-$B

sectionSummary and conclusions labelsec:sum

In this paper two conjugated multi-spacecraft studies of interplanetary (IP) shock propagation are presented It aims to determine how IP shocks develop and evolve in spatial and temporal propagation The spatial separation of observations is addedaround 40millionkm In this scale we do not see any significant development of the IP shocks The shock parameters are similar within their estimated error at each location No sign of wave dispersion was observed

The Event May 7 2007added is a fast-forward (FF) shock event appears planar and tilted $5642^circ$ to the Sun-Earth line The tilt of this planar shock surface is almost identical to the usual propagation of the Parker spiral impacting the Earth Therefore the origin of the shock is co-rotating stream interactions (CIRs) which agrees with the detected CIR on that day There is no sign of temporal change in this scale In the spatial range of 40million km no change was observable The G1-minor geomagnetic storm happened after this shock was detected indicating this shock event caused the geomagnetic storm on that day

The Event April 23 2007 is a fast reverse (FR) shock event and it appears the shape of the shock is not uniform and twisted from the STEREO$-$A spacecraft to the other spacecraft along the transverse direction to the Sun-Earth line The shock normal vectors also were observed to be changing along the Y-axis A G1-minor geomagnetic storm occurred on this day similar to the fast-forward shock event of May 7 2007 Intriguingly the onset of this storm took place three hours before the shock detection time recorded by STEREO$-$A The termination of the storm partially coincided with the STEREO$-$A detection time The source of this shock is SIR/CIR The G1-minor geomagnetic storm with a $Kp$-5 index began before the shock detection It seems that the fast-moving solar wind instigated the minor storm before the arrival of the fast-reverse shock at the spacecraft's position The orientation irregularity can be potentially accounted for by the characteristic tilts of SIRs

No multipoint observation was made before using so many and so different probes The 3D spatial curve and the origin of the IP shocks are determined These macroscopic features were visible only in heliospheric magnetohydrodynamic simulations before However the known IP shock catalogues of the STEREO the Wind the ACE and the Cluster missions provided older observations A natural continuation of this study is using PSP the SolO and the BepiColombo citepmilillo10:bepic measurements for joint observations The larger spatial separation of the IP shock observations might allow us to observe the temporal development and dispersion of these shocks
